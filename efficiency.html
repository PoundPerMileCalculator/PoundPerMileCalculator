          The Tesla Model 3 is the electric sensation sweeping the streets. It's quiet, it's swift, and it has the kind of acceleration that makes your breakfast fly off the table if you’re not careful. Unlike most cars, it doesn’t sip fuel; it practically guzzles electrons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside, it’s minimalist, like driving a spaceship piloted by someone who has watched every sci-fi film ever. With a range that can stretch from London to Birmingham on a single charge, it’s the efficiency king of modern motoring. Clarkson would probably say it’s “a bloody miracle of wires and wizardry.”

          Toyota Prius

          The Prius is the hybrid that made the world stop and think: maybe boring can be brilliant. It glides along roads like a silent monk, saving petrol while you save money. You might feel virtuous, but don’t get too smug — your mates might still laugh at your choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the hood, it’s a clever marriage of petrol and electricity. Clarkson would nod in reluctant admiration, muttering something like, “I don’t hate it, though it makes me miss the roar of a proper engine.” Efficiency is its true superpower.
